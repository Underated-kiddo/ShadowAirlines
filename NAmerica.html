        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            North America is culturally diverse, especially in the United States and Canada, with influences from indigenous peoples, European settlers, African Americans, and waves of immigrants from around the world.,<br>
                In the United States, culture is often characterized by individualism, innovation, and a strong sense of national identity, with an emphasis on freedom and opportunity. <br>
                The country has a significant influence on global pop culture through its media, fashion, and technology. The U.S. is also known for its iconic music genres like jazz, rock, and hip-hop.<br>
                    Canada, while similar, has a strong emphasis on bilingualism, with both English and French as official languages. Its multiculturalism and commitment to social welfare are key features of Canadian culture.<br>
                        Both countries are known for their sports, such as American football, baseball, hockey, and basketball, and their food, which ranges from fast food to international cuisines.
