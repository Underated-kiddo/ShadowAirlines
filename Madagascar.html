        <h1>Madagascar</h1>
        <p>
            Madagascar is an island country located off the southeastern coast of Africa, in the Indian Ocean. 
            It is the world’s fourth-largest island, and its unique biodiversity makes it a fascinating destination for nature lovers. <br>
            The island is known for its distinct flora and fauna, with nearly 90% of its wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. <br>
            The country has a population of around 30 million people and its capital is Antananarivo.<br>
            Madagascar's history is rich, shaped by its early settlers from Southeast Asia and Africa, as well as later European influences. It was a French colony from 1897 until gaining independence in 1960. Despite facing significant economic challenges, including poverty and political instability, Madagascar is known for its rich natural resources and diverse ecosystems.

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            Madagascar has a rich and diverse culture influenced by both indigenous traditions and outside influences, particularly from Southeast Asia, Africa, and France.<br>
                The Malagasy people are divided into various ethnic groups, with the Merina, Betsimisaraka, and Betsileo being the largest groups. <br>
                These ethnic groups have distinct languages, but Malagasy is the official language, with French also widely spoken.<br>
                The culture of Madagascar places great importance on family and community. The concept of "fihavanana" (social harmony) is central to Malagasy life, where relationships, respect for others, and communal support are key values.<br>
                Key Aspects of Malagasy Culture:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Language and Literature:
                            Malagasy, a language derived from Austronesian roots, is the primary language spoken by the people.<br>
                                Literature and oral traditions, including poetry and storytelling, play an important role in maintaining the island’s rich cultural heritage.</li>
                        <li> 2. Religion and Spirituality:
                            Madagascar is predominantly Christian (both Roman Catholic and Protestant), but many Malagasy also practice ancestral worship and animism. Rituals and ceremonies to honor ancestors, known as "famadihana", are a significant cultural practice, where families exhume and re-wrap the remains of their ancestors as a sign of respect and continued connection.
                            </li>
                        <li>3. Art and Craftsmanship:
                            The Malagasy are skilled in various crafts, including weaving, pottery, and wood carving. The lamba (a traditional cloth) is an iconic garment worn in daily life and ceremonies. The zafimaniry wood carvings and Malagasy jewelry are also highly regarded for their intricate designs
                            </li>
                        <li>4. Music and Dance:
                            Music is an integral part of Malagasy culture. The island's music is diverse, with influences from Africa, Southeast Asia, and France. Traditional instruments such as the valiha (a bamboo tube zither) and marovany (a type of drum) are commonly used in performances. Traditional dances and songs often accompany social events and festivals.
                            </li>
                        <li>5. Cuisine:
                            Malagasy cuisine is primarily based on rice (the staple food), accompanied by a variety of meats, vegetables, and spices. Dishes such as "romazava" (a stew) and "ravitoto" (pounded cassava leaves with pork) are common. The food culture is influenced by African, French, and Asian ingredients and cooking styles.
                            </li>
                        <li>6. Festivals:
                            The Malagasy people celebrate many local and national festivals. "Fête de l'Indépendance" (Independence Day) on June 26th is a major celebration. Local festivals, like "Hira Gasy", combine music, dance, and theatre and are an important way to preserve and share Malagasy traditions.
