        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            Australia’s culture is a mix of Indigenous traditions and modern Western influences, particularly British, due to its colonial history. 
            The Indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a rich cultural heritage, with traditions such as dreamtime stories, ceremonies, and art.<br>
                Modern Australia is known for its multiculturalism, with waves of immigrants from Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world contributing to a diverse cultural landscape. <br>
                Australians are often known for their laid-back lifestyle and love for outdoor activities such as surfing, sports, and barbecues. Major sporting events like the Melbourne Cup and AFL are deeply embedded in the culture.<br>
                    The national cuisine is influenced by British heritage but has also incorporated flavors from Asia and the Mediterranean, with popular dishes like meat pies, Vegemite, and seafood.
