        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            South African culture is deeply influenced by its history of apartheid and the multicultural society that emerged post-apartheid. 
            The country is often referred to as the "Rainbow Nation" due to its diverse population of over 11 official languages, including Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, and English.<br>
                South Africa's music, art, and dance are influenced by African, European, and Asian cultures, with styles like Kwaito and traditional drumming being popular. <br>
                South African cuisine is also diverse, with bobotie (a spiced minced meat dish), bunny chow (a curry-filled bread), and braai (barbecue) being some iconic foods.<br>
                    Sport plays a major role in national identity, with rugby, soccer, and cricket being the most popular. 
                    South Africa’s wildlife and national parks, like Kruger National Park, are central to the country's tourism.
